hope second time's a charm!

please note:
1. GET /stats will provide the info:
ip address
first time accessing
last time accessing
number of /prev reqest this client sent

2. I read about 'promises' and couldn't manage to use it instead of callback

3. I replaced the mongo DB with two arrays. "prev array" can be used as a 'request container' if you'll add more object with different names.
